## Variables

In the final data set there are three variables.
These are described below with details of their creation.

# Activity

This is the activity the volunteers were performing when the data was collect.
This was extracted from the "y.txt" dataset for both test and train as a numeric value, and combined.
Using a lookup from the file "activity_lables.txt" this numbers were converted to the activity description.

# Mean

This is the mean value of the acticity data.
This was extracted from the "X.txt" dataset for both test and train, and combined.
This had to be averaged on a row basis for each experiments data, and then average over each activity to get the final table.

# SD

This is the standard deviation value of the acticity data.
This was extracted from the "X.txt" dataset for both test and train, and combined.
This had to be calculated on a row basis for each experiments data, and then average over each activity to get the final table.
